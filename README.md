# JS Game Project

This is a JavaScript game created as the first project for the Ironhack web development bootcamp. It is a 4K-style rhythm game where the player has to press keys and change the color of the player to match the color of the circles.

## How to Play

To start playing the game, open `index.html` in your web browser. The game will start automatically. The objective of the game is to press the correct key on your keyboard when the circles reach the bottom of the screen, and also change the color of the player to match the color of the circle. There are four different keys you can press: D, F, J, and K. The color of the player will change to either blue or red when the spacebar key is pressed. Each correct key press and color change will earn you a point. If you press the wrong key or the player color does not match the circle color, you will not earn any points for that circle. The circles are randomly generated with either a blue or red color, so the game will be different each time you play.

## Technologies Used

This game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game logic and event handling were written in JavaScript. The styling and layout of the game were done using CSS, and the structure of the game was created using HTML.

## Future Improvements

While the game is functional, there are some improvements that could be made in the future. Some possible ideas for improvement include:

- Adding music to the game to enhance the rhythm aspect
- Adding more levels or difficulty settings to keep the game interesting
- Adding a high score feature to encourage players to keep playing and improve their scores
